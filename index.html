        <p>If your brakes are squeaking, grinding, or not working properly, it's time to get them repaired. Not all brake repair shops are created equal, so be sure to do your research before bringing your car in for service. You'll want to find a shop that has experience with the type of car you drive and can give you an estimate of how much the repairs will cost. Be sure to ask about any warranty that may be included with the repair.

        <p>It is important to get your vehicle inspected on a regular basis to ensure that it is safe and roadworthy. Depending on your state or territory, you may need to get your vehicle inspected every 6 months or 12 months. To find out when your vehicle is due for inspection, check your registration papers or contact your local motor registry. When you take your vehicle for inspection, the inspector will check that it meets all the required safety standards.

        <img src="img/Oil change.webp" alt="">
        <p>Assuming you need an oil change, the first thing you should do is find a reputable auto shop. Once you've found a shop, make an appointment for your car. Be sure to arrive on time for your appointment. At the shop, a technician will likely ask you what kind of oil you would like. There are many different types of oil, so it's important to know which one is right for your car. If you're not sure, ask the technician for a recommendation.
